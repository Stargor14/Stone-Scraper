<h1>Stone-Scrapper</h1>

Lol another Dr. Stone inspired project

In the anime, the main character uses a program he wrote to find the geographic origin of a # on twitter, since I'm a filthy copycat, I'm going to attempt to do the same thing. This project might end up turning into an ML project where I try to use a Neural Network to capture sentiment of tweets using their text, but we wil see.

Give a #hashtag or a keyword to look at, will find the origin post/location of that topic

Scraps twitter, looks at post hashtag and keywords to create a statistical probability that the trend started there

Turns out the majority of the Twitter APIs functionality is actually locked behind a paywall! Isn't capitalism great? So instead of the Twitter API, I'm going to use selenium and beautifulsoup to scrape for information.
Quite frankly I think that I'll learn more through this approach, so It's not necessarily a bad thing.

Now that I think of it, I might as well analyze sentiment about Dr. Stone as a first query.

Well I guess this is jus way too fun, I'm making a type racer bot now

https://twitter.com/90spics_ <-- scrap this cool anime page and auto set wallpaper or something every day with random photo from their feed

Turns out u cant actually find geotags of everything, especilly not through scraping, it is borderline impossible to seperate every element with how twitter is trying to make it
impossible to NOT use their api. Instead of tweet class name being "tweet" or "tweet-text" like in the past, they chosen to make the class names absolute giberish. The code is mostly just me trying to decipher where the text is.
