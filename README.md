# Stone-Scraper
Lol another Dr. Stone inspired project

In the anime, the main character uses a program he wrote to find the geographic orgin of a # on twitter, since I'm a filthy copycat, I'm goign to attempt to do the same thing. 
This project might end up turning into an ML project where I try to use a Neural Network to capture sentiment of tweets using their text, but we wil see.

Give a #hashtag or a keyword to look at, will find the origin post/location of that topic

Scraps twitter, looks at post hashtag and keywords to create a statistical probability that the trend started there

Turns out the majority of the Twitter APIs functionality is actually locked behind a paywall! Isn't capitalism great? So instead of the Twitter API, I'm going to use selenium and 
beutifulsoup to scrape for information. Quite frankly I think that I'll learn more through this approch, so It's not neccessarily a bad thing.

Now that I think of it, I might as well analyze sentiment about Dr. Stone as a first query.
